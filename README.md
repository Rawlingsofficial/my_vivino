# Welcome to My Vivino
The goal of this project is to build a modern and accurate
 wine recommendation system using data science techniques. 
 with a machine learning-based approach, 
 leveraging customer preferences and historical data to provide personalized wine recommendations.

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
the steps taken to complet this projects are:
Data Collection and Cleaning:
-Gather data from multiple sources, including Vivino, Bevmo, Wine-Searcher, etc.
-Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Data Exploration:
-Analyze the dataset to understand wine attributes, user reviews, ratings, prices, etc.
-Identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Data Visualization:
-Create visualizations to showcase insights from the data exploration phase.
-Visualize distribution of ratings, price ranges, regions, and other relevant attributes.
Machine Learning Model Building:
-Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for recommendation (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid methods).
-Train the model using historical user interactions (ratings, reviews) with wines.
Model Evaluation and Tuning:
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
-Fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the model for accuracy and relevance.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
the steps taken are as follows (1) began by fetching the required dataset for my project on kagel.com,making sure it was a wine dataset
(2) installed and imported the required libries for the project
(3) load the DATASET then CLEANED the data 
(4) EXPLORED data
(5) Visualize DATA ploting graphs
(6) make predictions

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
apart from the nesesary libries needed, no instalayions were made for this project


## Usage
print(my_wine_data_head.to_string(index=False))  :reads and prints data
def clean_wine_data : cleans data  and find missing values 
def pie(wines) : plots a pie chart 
def wine_correlation  : corelates the data
def fit_model_prediction : make prediction base on data to determine prices
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
